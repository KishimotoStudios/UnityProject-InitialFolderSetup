# UnityProject-InitialFolderSetup
Windows batch file to create common folders inside Assets folder (Unity project).

How to use:
- Put the .cmd file in your newly created Unity project root folder.
- Run the batch file.
- If you want it to create special folders (Editor, Resources, etc.) run the batch file with 'all' parameter.
- (Optional) Rename the .cmd file and add a dot as the first character of the filename so Unity can ignore the file.
